# AWS Re/Start Labs

Welcome! This repository contains my work from the **AWS Re/Start** course 

## 🍵 Tools I’m Learning With

- Python 3 🐍  
- Bash / CLI basics 💻  
- Cloud concepts via AWS ☁️  
- A dash of patience & snacks 🍪

## 📁 What's Inside

A collection of beginner-friendly Python scripts — messy in the best way (because that’s how we learn):

- 🔢 Numbers & data types  
- 🧵 Strings, loops & logic  
- 📂 File handling (JSON, text, etc.)  
- 🛠️ Debugging, ciphers & admin tasks  
- 🧬 Insulin bio case study

| `Lab15_sys-admin.py`          | Simulating system admin tasks               |
| `Lab16_debugger.py`           | Debugging Python code                       |
| `Lab17_debug-caesar-*.py`     | More Caesar cipher debugging tasks          |
| `string-insulin.py`           | Bioinformatics-style insulin parsing        |
| `net-charge.py`               | Calculating net charge of amino acids       |

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated

- Writing clean, modular Python code
- Using Python’s built-in data types and control structures
- File handling with text and JSON formats
- Applying basic debugging techniques
- Simulating sysadmin tasks via scripting

---

## 📄 Documentation Practice

- Each script includes in-line comments to explain logic and functionality  
- Organized filenames and lab numbering for clear navigation  
- This README provides an overview of the content, context, and learning objectives

## 📌 Why This Repo?

This repo is a record of my coding journey through AWS Re/Start.  
Each script represents a step forward — debugging errors, learning logic, and building confidence.

## 🌼 Why I’m Doing This

To build confidence in code, grow my technical skills, and remind myself that I *can* do hard things — especially with tea and lofi in the background.
